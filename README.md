## Important Notes

- You **must** run the script as Administrator or it won't be able to modify the hosts file.
- Changes take effect system-wide on Windows.
- To fully block popular sites, both `example.com` and `www.example.com` will be added to the hosts file.
- Some browsers or antivirus tools may bypass hostsâ€“file DNS resolution (see README tips for details).
